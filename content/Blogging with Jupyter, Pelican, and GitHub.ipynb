    "Getting this blog set up was no easy feat.  After some preliminary reading online, I came away with the impression that the easiest/best way of creating my desired static coding/research/data-science blog would be by using Jupyter, Pelican, and GitHub together. After all, I found several blogs online that used this approach to great effect.  However, as someone who is still very new to Python, has had limited experience with any kind of programming and zero exposure to Git(Hub) (read: \"utterly bewildered by\"), making sense of the plethora of (often conflicting) online blogposts, tutorials, and guides for using such an approach became an arduous task.   After MANY failed attempts at getting the blog up by following the available tutorials online (to the letter), I finally managed it by integrating various steps across several sources ([source1](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/how-to-setup-a-data-science-blog/), [source2](http://wtbarnes.github.io/blogging-howto/), [source3](https://spapas.github.io/2013/10/07/pelican-static-windows/)).  \n",

    "I suspect the fact that I'm working on a Windows OS may have contributed to some of my struggles.  Nevertheless, I decided to write yet another guide for creating a blog using Jupyter, Pelican, and GitHub.  I do this primarily so that I can re-trace my steps if something should ever go awry with my blog (and I need to start from scratch), but also for others who may have experienced similar difficulties in getting up and running using other tutorials.  While the approach below worked for me, I unfortunately cannot garauntee that it will work for you (or, even if it does, that it is the best approach).\n",

Ultimately, the blog will be available online at http://hendrikvanb.github.io (if you are following this guide, you will want to replace all instances of *'hendrikvanb'* with your own github username!). For reasons that will become clearer in Step 5, I'm therefore going to create a new folder called `hendrikvanb.github.io`.

Crucially, however, Pelican requires some additional metadata in order to import Jupyter notebooks as posts correctly.  One way of doing this is to create a file that has the same name as my notebook, but with the extension `.ipynb-meta`. In this file, I must then include metadata entries for `Title`, `Slug`, `Date`, `Category`, `Tags`, `Author`, and `Summary`.  Once I've created this file, I must include it alongside my notebook file in the `content` folder of my local blog repository.\n",
